    "# Exercise 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise 4 includes five problems that you need to solve with programming, and by providing answers to questions. For each problem you need to modify the notebook by adding your own solutions. Remember to save and commit your changes locally, and push your changes to GitHub after each major change! Regular commits will help you to keep track of your changes (and revert them if needed). Pushing your work to GitHub will ensure that you don't lose any work in case your computer crashes (can happen!).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Completing this exercise takes approximately: 2-6 hours** (based on previous year statistics). However, the time it takes can vary significantly from student to student, so we recommended that you start immediately working on the exercise to avoid issues meeting with the deadline.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Due date\n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit (push) your Exercise answers to your personal Github repository approx. **2.5 weeks after the release of the exercise (submit by Sunday 3th December at 23:59)**. \n",
    "      \n",
    "### Start your exercise in CSC Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can start programming, you need to launch the CSC Notebook instance and clone your **personal copy of the Exercise repository** (i.e. something like `exercise-4-htenkanen`) there using Git.

    "Jupyter Notebooks are documents that can be used and run inside the JupyterLab programming environment (e.g. at [notebooks.csc.fi](https://notebooks.csc.fi/)) containing the computer code and rich text elements (such as text, figures, tables and links). \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will practice using some of the basic DEM analysis approaches using Python's [Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) and [Xarray-spatial](https://xarray-spatial.org/) libraries, in order to gain knowledge of topography of an area and use different raster layers to find a suitable place for your scenario. You’ll be using elevation, slope and aspect, so think of a scenario where all of these can be utilized. In these instructions, **placing a summer cottage will be used as an example with the following preferences**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **the higher the better**\n",
    "- **some slope is good but not too steep**\n",
    "- **the ridge should be pointing southwards (who wouldn't like more sun on their patio..)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to use your own scenario if you wish, as long as you come up with one that utilizes the same layers or use the same as in these instructions.\n",
    "The goal in this exercise is to calculate **weighted overlay**. For each preference, you need to create a raster layer and combine them using weighted sum. You’ll need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- run different functions to get the layers (e.g. slope and aspect)\n",
    "- reclassify the layers according to your preferences\n",
    "- sum all layers together (weighting), and\n",
    "- smooth the results to get a more general view on the suitability (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing an overlay analysis such as this, it is important to ensure the preference layers are scaled in a similar, for example from 1 to 5 (which is the scale used in the instuctions).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the exercise, we use elevation data (`data/22S_DEM.tif`) from eastern Finland, which is in [GeoTIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF) format and provided for you in the `data` -directory. "

They are libraries that make working with multidimentional data easy (such as raster data). **They work in a quite similar manner as pandas/geopandas**, but they represent/store data as **matrises** (multidimentional arrays) instead of columns (Series) in a GeoDataFrame. But the intuitition and the \"feel\" of using xarray Datasets is quite similar as when working with GeoDataFrames. Hence, using the Xarray Datasets should be quite straightforward if you have some experience in working with pandas/geopandas."
